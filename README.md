OCaml-Core-OpenShift
====================

OpenShift cartridge for OCaml with Jane Street's Core.

This is simple cartridge for creating applications based on OCaml with Core.
There already exists other [OCaml cartridge](https://bitbucket.org/jpathy/ocaml-openshift),
you may want to check it out too. Originally I thought my cartridge would be different,
however during the development I gradually found out that those people did quite good
job and converged to very similar design myself. At least I have learned something.

To start with OCaml and Core read [Real Wold OCaml](https://realworldocaml.org/).

Packages expected to be present:

* Core
* Async
